This is my first simple generator Python project.
I created a password generator that asks the user to choose the password character length.
Afterwards, the user is asked what kind of characters they want in the password.
Customization is a big factor of this project.
After the user chooses their preferences, the project will create a random password.
The password will constantly change when the program will rerun.
